Japanese designers in the 90s designed the Shinkasen high-speed bullet train using 
the science of biomimicry. By studying the kingfisher, a bird known for its ability
to dive into water at high speeds without making a splash, they were able to
create a train that didn't generate sonic booms when exiting mountain tunnels, 
which had been a nuisance for Japanese residents nearby. They also reduce air
resistance by 30%, which significantly lowered energy consumption.
