The Shinkasen bullet train was designed in the 90s in Japan by using the 
science of biomimicry. By drawing inspiration from the a kingfisher, a type of 
bird known for its ability to dive at high speeds into water without making 
a splash, the train's design made it possible for it to move at high speeds
through tunnels without generating a sonic boom. It also reduced energy
consumption by generating 30% less air resistance. It is...pretty awesome.
